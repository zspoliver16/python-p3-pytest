# pytest

## Learning Goals

- Explain how pytest is used to ensure our code works as expected.
- Configure an application to run pytest.
- Describe the structure of a pytest test.
- Execute pytest with flags to ensure its output is what we need.
- Interpret pytest output to find the sources of errors.

## Key Vocab

- **Unit Testing**: a development process where the smallest testable parts of
  an application are independently tested for proper functionality.
- **Test-Driven Development**: a development process where tests are written to
  meet expectations for an application before code is written to meet those
  expectations.
- **Assertion**: a statement that determines if a wrapped statement produces a
  falsy value or exception. In either case, the assertion fails and the
  execution of code stops.

## Introduction

pytest is a testing framework in Python that makes it easy to write short,
easy-to-parse tests for applications ranging from a single function to huge
libraries.

## pytest Helps You Write Better Programs

pytest is primarily used for a task called **unit testing**. Unit testing is a
provess in which the smallest parts of an application- no matter how large the
application- are looked at individually and tested to make sure they operate as
intended. Testing is usually carried out by developers themselves, but sometimes
by teams of quality assurance (QA) engineers as well.

Unit tests will typically run on many functions at once with many different
types of input. The number of failures with their descriptions will be returned
to the tester so that they can update any non-functional code. Tests can be run
quickly and as many times as desired. They can also be run on code that doesn't
exist yet- this allows for a process called **test-driven development** (TDD),
where failures are used to inform what code to write next.

### An Example of TDD

Let's say you want to write a function that interpolates into a string: given a
name, it should return "Welcome, name!"

This is fairly simple to write, but even easier to test. Let's start by writing
an assertion that will raise an Exception if the return value of our function
is incorrect. Open up the Python shell and enter the following:

```console
>>> def interpolate_welcome(name):
...     pass
...
>>> assert interpolate_welcome('Guido') == 'Welcome, Guido!'
```

You should see the following output:

```console
# => Traceback (most recent call last):
# =>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# => AssertionError
```

This tells us that in the most recent block of code (the assertion), there was
an error on the first line. As this is an assertion, the error is easy enough
to parse out: `interpolate_welcome()` doesn't interpolate the name we pass in!

Let's use that assertion to drive the development of some working code:

```console
>>> def interpolate_welcome(name):
...     return f'Welcome, {name}!'
...
>>> assert interpolate_welcome('Guido') == 'Welcome, Guido!'
```

You should see no output from this assertion- that means that it worked!

Simple assertions are _enough_ for us to do TDD, but they don't give us many
details. We'll see how pytest improves upon this process in just a bit.

## What Does a pytest Test Look Like?

While you've worked with several pytest tests up to this point, you may not
have dug into the test files themselves. Let's do that now.

### pytest File Structure

The first thing that we need to do to create an application environment that
supports pytest is include either `pytest.ini` or `setup.py`. pytest generates
its own paths when it is run, and can often struggle to find the files that you
wish to test. The inclusion of these files allows us to specify where pytest
should start building paths. We give it two options: `.`, the root directory,
and `lib`, the application directory.

Once this is set up, we should create a directory to house our tests. This can
be named any valid Python package name (no dashes!), but we recommend making it
clear that it contains test. Ours is contained in `lib/` and is simply called
`testing/`.

We've put a couple of tests inside of `testing`: `test_string.py` and
`subdirectory/bool_test.py`. pytest files must be named either starting with
"test_" or ending with "_test". pytest will look in the current directory and
every subdirectory for any files that match this naming pattern and execute any
tests within.

### pytest Test Structure

The test themselves have to be named fairly strictly: `test_{name}` for
functions and `Test{Group}` for classes. We'll explain what this means a bit
more later on in Phase 3- just know that pytest classes contain groups of tests
and pytest functions are single tests.

***

## Running pytest

pytest can be executed from the command line using the command `pytest`. This
will run every test in the current directory and any subdirectories, with paths
to separate files being determined by `pytest.ini`. So long as you execute
pytest from one of the directories specified there, you shouldn't have any
issues getting your tests to run.

Let's start off by simply running `pytest`. Enter your virtual environment from
the project root directory with `pipenv install; pipenv shell` and enter the
command `pytest`:

```console
$ pytest
(python-p3-pytest) python-p3-pytest % pytest

>       assert return_true() == True
E       assert False == True
E        +  where False = return_true()

====== short test summary info ======
FAILED string_functions.py contains a function "return_true" that returns True. - assert False == True
====== 1 failed, 2 passed in 0.05s ======
```

There's a lot to parse here! Rather than jumping right into this output, let's
first figure out how to tailor our output to our needs. We only failed one test,
after all- how can we run the one that failed?
